				This paper examines the impact of the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 on the domestic fares of the crash carrier, using a difference-in-difference approach. The results show that the crash reduced fares of Alaska Airlines relative to those of its competitors only in the months right after the crash, indicating that the financial ramifications are not persistent.

				Employers face an obstacle when hiring employees: without the employees' work records, the employers do not know what quality of performance to expect. Existing experimental literature in agency theory provides employers with their employees' work history at no cost. I extend this research by placing a price on the information to develop a more realistic case. Through experimental evidence, I find employers absorb the cost of obtaining history, and do not shift the burden of the fee onto the employees in the form of lower wages. If employers have access to employees' history, they offer wages that are positively correlated with the employees' work ethic. However, when they are not presented with a history, the employers base wages on their own experiences.
