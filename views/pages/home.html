        I am a Managing Economist in the Economics & Damages practice at
        Berkeley Research Group. Prior to joining BRG, I was a Consultant at
        Micronomics, an economic research and consulting firm based in Los
        Angeles, California.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been engaged with litigation matters involving patent
        infringement, antitrust, and fraud in a variety of industries, including
        telecommunications, semiconductors, insurance, and transportation. My
        consulting experience includes extensive use of econometric techniques,
        large database management, regression analysis, and calculation of lost
        profits and reasonable royalties.
      </p>

        I received a Ph.D. and M.A. in Economics from the University of
        California, Irvine, and a B.S. in Mathematics and Economics from the
        University of California, San Diego.
